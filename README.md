<img src='https://lemonadejs.net/templates/v1/img/home.png' align="right" width="50%">

Lemonadejs is a super lightweight vanilla javascript micro-library (4Kb). It aims to help the integration between the JavaScript (controllers) and the HTML (view). It supports two-way binding and integrates natively with Jsuites to help to create amazing interfaces quicker.<br><br>

It would help you to deliver reusable components and does not require transpilers, babel, or hundreds of other dependencies and work just fine in any javascript dev environment. Lemonadejs has a quick learning curve and keeps coding fun and very close to native JS.
